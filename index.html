      <p>
          Hello, thanks for visiting my personal webpage! I am a computer science student about to
          begin my second year at the University of Cambridge (Robinson College).
      </p>
      <p>
          I am primarily interested in Machine Learning because I love how simple, mathematical rules
          can create complex systems with a deeper, fundamental understanding of a problem than what
          would be possible by using explicit heuristics. I think ML has amazing practical
          applications for many disciplines because we can deploy adaptable, cutting edge ML
          technology on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am also interested in computer security because I think it is really exciting to take a
          product and, rather than asking "what does this do?", ask "what <i>can</i> this do?". I think,
          as Machine Learning is used more and more in every day life, the role of security in ML
          will become increasingly relevant in protecting our privacy.

          During sixth form I read <i>Generative Deep Learning</i> by D. Foster which got me
          really excited about applying ML to generative tasks (specifically for images: it's
          amazing how we can use such rigid rules to produce organic-looking shapes). After
          participating in Google CodeIn 2019 (for TensorFlow), I wanted to apply what I had learnt
          to a more difficult project, so I created my own implementation of
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09300.pdf" class="greylink">a VAE-GAN</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The VAE-GAN framework trains a generator by combining the losses from a VAE and a GAN.
          The VAE loss focusses more on correctly reconstructing the content of an image, while
          the GAN loss is more focused on creating an image that has a realistic style, so
          combining the two (hopefully) gives us the advantages of both. I trained the model of my
          own dataset of faces scraped from IMDB to produce the results above. Results
