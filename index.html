            Hello, thanks for visiting my personal webpage! I am a computer science student about to
            begin my second year at the University of Cambridge (Robinson College).
        </p>
        <p>
            I am primarily interested in Machine Learning because I love how simple, mathematical rules
            can create complex systems with a deeper, fundamental understanding of a problem than what
            would be possible by using explicit heuristics. I think ML has amazing practical
            applications for many disciplines because we can deploy adaptable, cutting edge ML
            technology on a massive scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also interested in computer security because I think it is really exciting to take a
            product and, rather than asking "what does this do?", ask "what <i>can</i> this do?". I think,
            as Machine Learning is used more and more in every day life, the role of security in ML
            will become increasingly relevant in protecting our privacy.

          <p>
            During sixth form I read <i>Generative Deep Learning</i> by D. Foster which got me
            really excited about applying ML to generative tasks (specifically for images: it's
            amazing how we can use such rigid rules to produce organic shapes). After participating
            in Google CodeIn 2019 (for TensorFlow), I wanted to apply what I had learnt to a more
            difficult project, so I created my own implementation of a
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09300.pdf" class="greylink">VAE-GAN</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VAE-GAN framework trains a generator by combining the losses from a VAE and a GAN.
            The VAE loss focusses more on correctly reconstructing the content of an image, while
            the GAN loss is more focused on creating an image that has a realistic style, so
            combining the two (hopefully) gives us the advantages of both. I trained the model of my
            own dataset of faces scraped from IMDB to produce 
            <a href="https://josephhrance.github.io/images/vaegan.png" class="greylink">these</a>
            results.

          <h5 style="position: relative; top: 5px;"><i>(2020-2021)</i></h5>
          <p>
            The way professionals play games such as chess or go has been
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y" class="greylink">revolutionised with the use of Reinforcement Learning</a>
            (RL) agents that are able play at a substantially higher level than the best humans.
            After reading Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto, I wanted to see if I could
            create a similar agent in the sport of fencing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difficulty with this is that fencing is a lot messier than board games: the state
            space is difficult to define, there are many more factors that could affect decisions,
            and decisions are made continuously (we don't take turns).
          </p>
          <p>
            My idea was to manually classify each action in a bank of videos of myself fencing into a
            predefined action class and then train a RL agent that uses this information along with
            the current match state (score, time, action history, ...) to predict the value of each
            possible action at any point in the match, where the value of winning a match is 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is something I would like to revisit: although it produced some interesting
            results, I think it would benefit from a more effective data collection strategy. Nonetheless,
            I really enjoyed this project because I think RL will be increasingly relevant in the future.

              As president of my sixth form's
              <a href="https://github.com/Joseph-Rance/Computing-Soc-old" class="greylink">computing society</a>,
              I organised weekly tutorials, talks, debates, and competitions. I won a Jack Petchey
              award for this, which included Â£250 to spend on the society. Over the course of a few
              months, I ran a project where we modelled, printed, and assembled a robotic arm. We
              then wrote code that uses a camera on the arm to automatically detect objects placed in
              front of it and pick them up. The focus of this project was on integrating the
              components together and creating efficient code that could run on the arm's minimal
              computing power.

          <h5 style="position: relative; top: 5px;"><i>(SUMMER 2022)</i></h5>
          <p>
            I am currently doing a summer internship at the Cambridge University Computer
            Laboratory, in which I am researching how to insert backdoors into Machine Learning
            models. The idea is to covertly modify someone's model so that it retains high accuracy
            on the dataset (so the backdoor is not found), but when a certain trigger transformation
            is applied to an image that is passed to the model (for example, this could be a
            inserting a specific pattern), the model has new behaviour. This could potentially be
            very dangerous (see:
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06733.pdf" class="greylink">BADNETs</a>
            ). The idea I am investigating is a different threat model for inserting the backdoor
            trigger by different preprocessing techniques.

          I am also a keen fencer, having represented England in the Paris CEP international. I am
          currently the Eastern Region senior champion and I'm ranked 23rd in Great Britain. I hope
          to fence internationally for Belgium this season.
