        Hello, thanks for visiting my personal webpage! I am a computer science student about to
        begin my second year at the University of Cambridge (Robinson College).
    </p>
    <p>
        I am primarily interested in Machine Learning because I love how simple, mathematical rules
        can create complex, intelligent systems with a deeper, fundamental understanding of a
        problem than what would be possible by using explicit heuristics. I think ML has amazing
        practical applications for many disciplines because it allows us to deploy adaptable,
        cutting edge technology on a massive scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also interested in security because I think it is really exciting to take a product
        and, rather than asking "what does this do?", ask "what *can* this do?". I think, as Machine
        Learning is used more and more in every day life, the role of security in ML will become
        increasingly relevant in protecting our privacy.
