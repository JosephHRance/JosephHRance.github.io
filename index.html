      <p>
          Hello, thanks for visiting my personal webpage! I am a computer science student about to
          begin my second year at the University of Cambridge (Robinson College).
      </p>
      <p>
          I am primarily interested in Machine Learning because I love how simple, mathematical rules
          can create complex systems with a deeper, fundamental understanding of a problem than what
          would be possible by using explicit heuristics. I think ML has amazing practical
          applications for many disciplines because we can deploy adaptable, cutting edge ML
          technology on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am also interested in computer security because I think it is really exciting to take a
          product and, rather than asking "what does this do?", ask "what <i>can</i> this do?". I think,
          as Machine Learning is used more and more in every day life, the role of security in ML
          will become increasingly relevant in protecting our privacy.

        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 10px;">VAE-GAN</h4>
        <h5 style="position: relative; top: 5px;"><i>(2020-2021)</i></h5>
        <p>
          During sixth form I read <i>Generative Deep Learning</i> by D. Foster which got me
          really excited about applying ML to generative tasks (specifically for images: it's
          amazing how we can use such rigid rules to produce organic shapes). After participating
          in Google CodeIn 2019 (for TensorFlow), I wanted to apply what I had learnt to a more
          difficult project, so I created my own implementation of a
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09300.pdf" class="greylink">VAE-GAN</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The VAE-GAN framework trains a generator by combining the losses from a VAE and a GAN.
          The VAE loss focusses more on correctly reconstructing the content of an image, while
          the GAN loss is more focused on creating an image that has a realistic style, so
          combining the two (hopefully) gives us the advantages of both. I trained the model of my
          own dataset of faces scraped from IMDB to produce 
          <a href="https://github.com/JosephHRance/JosephHRance.github.io/raw/master/vaegan.png" class="greylink">these</a>
          results.

        <h4 style="position: relative; top: 10px;">RL fencing agent</h4>
        <h5 style="position: relative; top: 5px;"><i>(2020-2021)</i></h5>
        <p>
          The way professionals play games such as chess or go has been
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y" class="greylink">revolutionised with the use of Reinforcement Learning</a>
          (RL) agents that are able play at a substantially higher level than the best humans.
          After reading Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto, I wanted to see if I could
          create a similar agent in the sport of fencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty with this is that fencing is a lot messier than board games: the state
          space is difficult to define, there are many more factors that could affect decisions,
          and decisions are made continuously (we don't take turns).
        </p>
        <p>
          My idea was to manually classify each action in a bank of videos of myself fencing into a
          predefined action class and then train a RL agent that uses this information along with
          the current match state (score, time, action history, ...) to predict the value of each
          possible action at any point in the match, where the value of winning a match is 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          A value function for a state action pair in fencing is actually very useful. You could
          use it to predict which fencer is more likely to win, which actions are most effective at
          each point, and what a fencer's strengths and weaknesses are. Analysis of the model's
          weights indicated that the actions which had the most impact on the value were a stop hit
          (lower value) and a fleche (higher value). The latter did not appear in the dataset, so
          we can discount this, but the former makes some sense because scoring a stop hit doesn't
          really give you as much to build from in your next hit (although it is possible this
          prediction is due to me going for stop hits when I'm out of ideas).
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is something I would like to revisit: I think it would benefit from a more
          effective data collection strategy (I imagine some kind of pose estimation or learnt
          action encoding). Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this project because I think RL will be
          increasingly relevant in the future, as it teaches an agent to be intelligent rather than
          to mimic something that is intelligent.
